# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

In this project, I developed a browser-based version of an Etch-a-Sketch, demonstrating my proficiency in DOM manipulation, JavaScript, and CSS. The main features include:

- Dynamic Grid Creation: I used JavaScript to create a 16x16 grid of square divs dynamically, ensuring efficient and scalable code without manual HTML modifications.

- Flexbox Layout: I implemented Flexbox to organize the grid, showcasing my ability to create responsive and visually appealing layouts.

- Hover Effect: By adding event listeners, I created a hover effect where the grid squares change color upon mouseover, simulating a drawing effect.

- Interactive Grid Size Adjustment: I included a button that prompts the user for a new grid size (up to 100x100). Upon input, the existing grid is replaced with the new one, maintaining the same overall dimensions.

- Enhanced Interactivity: For extra credit, I added features to randomize the squares' colors and progressively darken them with each interaction, highlighting my ability to incorporate advanced JavaScript functionalities and CSS properties.

This project underscores my capability to build interactive and responsive web applications, demonstrating problem-solving skills and an understanding of key web development concepts.
